# EDIA Utilities

This repository contains a set of utilities developed for the EDIA project by Fundación Vía Libre. EDIA is an initiative aimed at involving more people in the critical evaluation of artificial intelligence technologies, such as language models (e.g., ChatGPT), from a social and intersectional perspective.

## Repository Contents

The repository includes the following tools:

1. **youtube-downloader**: A Bash script that downloads audio and video from a YouTube link.
2. **transcribe-audio**: A Python program that transcribes audio from an MP3 file and saves the transcription to a text file.
3. **transcript-fixer**: TranscriptFixer is a Qt & C++ application for correcting and editing transcription texts with synchronized media playback.

Each program has its own `README.md` file within its respective directory, detailing installation and usage instructions.
